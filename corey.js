// I canceled adding to Git so I could show you.
// This is a file we added just to add an unvevrsioned file to git
// You can see in the commit dialog that the files that are already under source code control
// are in one section and the fils that are not yet under source code control are in another section
//By section, I mean, a different tree branch

// Notice that the file that we just committeed is not in github yet
//That's because we only committed it to the local repository that is on your computer
// We need to push it to github for it to be there.
// I wil do that now.

// Now I will add this new file.
