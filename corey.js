// I canceled adding to Git so I could show you.
// This is a file we added just to add an unversioned file to git
// You can see in the commit dialog that the files that are already under source code control
// are in one section and the fils that are not yet under source code control are in another section
//By section, I mean, a different tree branch

// Notice that the file that we just committed is not in github yet
//That's because we only committed it to the local repository that is on your computer
// We need to push it to github for it to be there.
// I wil do that now.

// Now I will add this new file.

// Still not there, of course, cause we haven't piushed.
// Pushing now.

// Notice that the file pushed to github did not have our most recent comments in it.
// That 's because we never checked in those most recent comments before pushing
// So we pushed the previously checked in version.
//
// If you change a file, then check it in, then checge it again, then check it in
// When tyou push, it'll push the two check ins separate check ins.
